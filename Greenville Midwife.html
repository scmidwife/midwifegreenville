And while many women, especially in the US, use doctors and medical professionals to provide the assistance they need, it hasn't always been this way. For the longest time, midwives were the experts of choice to assist with childbirth. And we're actually seeing more new moms choosing midwives over physicians, when they give birth these days.If you've thought about using a midwife to deliver your baby, but aren't sure whether or not to go that route, here are some distinct advantages that you can get from choosing to work with a midwife for your baby's delivery.<p><h2>Personalized Care </p></h2>When you choose to work with a midwife, you are getting the assistance of an expert who actually invests time getting to know you. Midwives, unlike most doctors, will spend a lot of time getting to know you, your unique circumstances and even your family, prior to the big day. In the weeks and months leading up to your delivery date, your midwife will make it a point to stay in touch. Most midwives regularly visit and coach their clients prior to childbirth. With the medical industry rapidly becoming less and less personalized, it's nice to know that there is a childbirth option available that puts you – and your baby – first. <h2><p>Less Expensive</p></h2>If you've toyed with the idea of a hospital delivery, you've probably noticed that it will not be cheap. Traditional medical costs continue to rise every year, and delivery costs are astronomical. Many obstetricians won't even book you on their schedule, unless you pay for your delivery – in full – before your delivery date arrives.Midwife services, on the other hand, are extremely affordable. A recent study found that child birth with a midwife, or alternative delivery professional, costs about 1/3 of traditional hospital deliveries. It's always nice to save money, especially when you have a new mouth to feed. Money is tight for all of us these days, so it's easy to understand why so many families are choosing to use a midwife instead of more expensive, traditional childbirth alternatives.<h2><p>More Flexibility</p></h2>Midwives can help to customize your childbirth experience. With many new mothers choosing underwater births, alternative pain management methods and other holistic choices for childbirth, it's much easier to find a midwife who can help you to deliver using these methods. Most physicians have only one (two if you count C-section) methods of delivery. With midwives, you simply have more options.As you can see, there are some very distinct advantages to using a midwife for the delivery of your baby. Keep these advantages in mind as you decide who to work with for your upcoming delivery<br><br><center><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=18aO-0RWTjJ1y2_7wKkpeenpwwohUHIkJ"
